This project explores the benefits of Agile methodologies in software development. It includes a comparison of Agile vs. Waterfall approaches and reflections on our sprint progress.  
 
## Interpreting User Needs and Implementing Them into a Program

To interpret user needs, I gather feedback from them to understand the problem they’re trying to solve. Then, I break it down into smaller, actionable tasks. Creating user stories helps by framing these requirements from the user's perspective, making it easier to prioritize features and deliver value incrementally.

## Approach to Developing Programs and Agile Processes for Future Work

I approach development by breaking down tasks into smaller pieces, starting with the core functionality, and refining it based on continuous feedback. In the future, I plan to incorporate processes like sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and continuous delivery to maintain alignment and deliver value quickly.

## Being a Good Team Member in Software Development

Being a good team member means communicating well, being reliable, and working collaboratively. It’s about sharing knowledge, respecting others’ input, and stepping up when needed to help the team achieve its goals.
